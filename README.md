# protoGen_to_slicc
this is a projrct of parsing outcome of protoGen to slicc for further analysis such performance test.
As we all know, resoning the whole process of current cache coherence process is hard. Therefore, protoGen solve this
problem. It can generate the protocol with high concurrency. Also, the outcome of protoGen is written by murphy that is used for model checking,
In order to test the generated protocol performance, it should be converted into SLICC. That is the project serves.
